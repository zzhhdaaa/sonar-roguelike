    text: WebGL FPS Accelerator (WFA) is a "Dynamic Resolution System" and an advanced
      "DPI Control System" for WebGL that improves the FPS of your game. WebGL FPS
      Accelerator allows you to provide a balance between performance (FPS) and image
      quality (DPI).

    text: 
    linkText: 
    url: 
  - heading: 
    text: Dynamic Resolution System allows you to dynamically adjust DPI-Render Scale,
      to reduce workload on the GPU. In cases where the application's frame rate
      reduces, WFA will gradually scale down the resolution to maintain a consistent
      frame rate instead.

  - heading: 
    text: --- Why am I getting errors about "Post Processing" or "Text Mesh Pro?"
    linkText: 
    url: 
  - heading: 
    text: You need to install these packages. Because these are dependencies of the
      asset. This will fix errors.
    linkText: 
    url: 
  - heading: 
    text: --- What happens if I keep the fpsMin and fpsMax settings very close together?
    linkText: 
    url: 
  - heading: 
    text: It depends on "dpiIncrease-dpiDecrease". For example, if dpiIncrease is
      "1", and if this amount changes FPS more than 5 fps (e.g. 7), then the target
      FPS range could be 7 or 8. Because if the target FPS range is smaller than
      7 (e.g. 30-32), then the plugin cannot enter that range sometimes, and it has
      to work forever with a loop of increasing-decreasing. For example, if the current
      FPS is 28, after DPI increase it can be 35 with extra 7 FPS, but this time,
      plugin will try to decrease DPI again because 35 is bigger than 30-32 range,
      and FPS will be 28 again, and the plugin will try to increase DPI again. This
      can make a loop forever. AND THIS MAY CAUSE GETTING SPIKES AND DROPS.

    text: --- The frame rate is the same with the asset or without. What is the problem?
    linkText: 
    url: 
  - heading: 
    text: '- If your frame rate is in "target fps range", the plugin will not do
      anything. Try to change fpsMin-fpsMax parameters.

      - You can disable
      "dynamic resolution" mode, and you can change DPI manually, to see if there
      is a difference. You should see downsampling on resolution. If you see down
      sampling but no difference on Frame Rate, you can try on different devices.
      If the graphics performance of the device is good or your project has low FPS
      because of the "CPU load", you may not see much difference.'
